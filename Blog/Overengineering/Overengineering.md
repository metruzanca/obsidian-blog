Can you brainstorm me some ideas of pitfalls? 

> Sure, here are some common pitfalls that developers may encounter when wrapping a key library like Redux with in-house tools and complex abstractions:
> 1. Over-engineering: Developers may be tempted to build overly complex abstractions around a library like Redux, which can lead to unnecessary code bloat and performance issues.
> 
> 2. Reinventing the wheel: Developers may try to build their own state management solutions instead of leveraging existing libraries like Redux. This can lead to duplication of effort and potentially less robust solutions.
> 
> 3. Breaking compatibility: Wrapping a library like Redux with in-house tools and abstractions can break compatibility with other libraries and tools, making it difficult to integrate with the wider ecosystem.
> 
> 4. Maintaining and updating: Developing and maintaining in-house tools and abstractions requires ongoing effort and can be time-consuming. This can divert resources away from other areas of the project.
> 
> 5. Lack of community support: In-house tools and abstractions may lack the community support and documentation available for established libraries like Redux. This can make it harder to find help when issues arise.
> 
> 6. Reinforcing knowledge silos: By building custom abstractions around a library like Redux, developers may reinforce knowledge silos within their team. This can make it harder to onboard new team members and may limit the use of the library to a specific team or project.
> 
> These are just a few examples of potential pitfalls when wrapping a key library like Redux with in-house tools and abstractions. It's important to carefully consider the tradeoffs of this approach and weigh them against the benefits before making a decision.

These are great. Any more? 


> Sure, here are a few more potential pitfalls to consider when wrapping a key library like Redux with in-house tools and abstractions:
> 7. Increased complexity: Building custom abstractions around a library like Redux can increase the overall complexity of the project. This can make it harder to debug issues and can lead to longer development times.
> 
> 8. Lack of expertise: Building custom abstractions requires a deep understanding of the underlying library and its APIs. If developers lack expertise in the library, they may inadvertently introduce bugs or inefficiencies into their custom solutions.
> 
> 9. Limited functionality: By building custom abstractions around a library like Redux, developers may miss out on some of the advanced features and functionality that are available in the library. This can lead to a less powerful and less flexible solution.
> 
> 10. Reduced portability: In-house tools and abstractions may be less portable than established libraries like Redux. This can make it harder to reuse code across different projects or to integrate with third-party tools and services.
> 
> 11. Incompatibility with future updates: As libraries like Redux evolve and update over time, in-house tools and abstractions may become increasingly incompatible with new versions. This can lead to additional development work and maintenance costs.
> 
> 12. Security risks: Building custom abstractions introduces additional security risks that may not exist when using established libraries like Redux. It can be difficult to ensure that custom solutions are secure and free from vulnerabilities.
> 
> These are just a few more potential pitfalls to consider when wrapping a key library like Redux with in-house tools and abstractions. It's important to carefully evaluate the tradeoffs of this approach and to consider the long-term impact on the project before making a decision.

Excellent. What about points about leaky abstractions? 

> Leaky abstractions are a common issue when building custom abstractions around a library like Redux. Here are some potential pitfalls to consider in this regard:
> 13. Excessive coupling: When building custom abstractions, it can be difficult to completely abstract away the underlying library. This can result in excessive coupling between the custom abstraction and the library, making it harder to swap out the library in the future.
> 
> 14. Limited functionality: Custom abstractions may not provide the same level of functionality as the underlying library, leading to a leaky abstraction. Developers may need to directly access the underlying library in certain cases, leading to a lack of consistency and added complexity.
> 
> 15. Increased complexity: Custom abstractions can introduce additional layers of complexity that may not be necessary. This can lead to a leaky abstraction, where developers are forced to "break through" the abstraction in order to access the underlying library.
> 
> 16. Debugging issues: When using custom abstractions, it can be harder to debug issues that arise in the underlying library. This is because the custom abstraction may hide some of the complexity and details of the underlying library, making it harder to pinpoint the root cause of an issue.
> 
> 17. Inefficiencies: Custom abstractions may introduce inefficiencies in the code. For example, if the abstraction is not designed optimally, it may add unnecessary overhead or result in slower performance.
> 
> 18. Compatibility issues: Custom abstractions may not be fully compatible with other libraries and tools that rely on the underlying library. This can lead to compatibility issues and make it harder to integrate with third-party tools and services.
> 
> These are just a few potential pitfalls to consider when building custom abstractions around a library like Redux. It's important to carefully evaluate the tradeoffs of this approach and to consider the long-term impact on the project before making a decision.

Any thoughts on the quote: "If your code is the most clever thing you've created, are you clever enough to debug it?" 

> This is a great quote that highlights the importance of writing maintainable and easy-to-understand code. Clever code that uses complex abstractions and advanced techniques may be impressive, but it can also be difficult to debug and maintain over time.
> 
> If a developer creates code that is too clever for its own good, it can lead to issues down the line. For example, if a bug arises, it may be difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the issue because the code is overly complex and difficult to understand. This can lead to longer development times, increased frustration, and reduced productivity.
> 
> On the other hand, if a developer writes code that is easy to understand and maintain, it can lead to faster development times, easier debugging, and improved productivity. Code that is written with maintainability in mind is less likely to introduce bugs, and if bugs do arise, they are often easier to identify and fix.
> 
> In summary, while it's tempting to write clever and complex code, it's important to consider the long-term impact on the project. Writing code that is easy to understand and maintain is often the better choice, as it leads to faster development times, easier debugging, and improved productivity.

What about the Write everything Twice principle? 

> The "Write everything twice" principle, also known as "duplication is better than the wrong abstraction," is a software development principle that suggests that it's better to write code that is duplicated rather than creating complex abstractions that may not be the right fit for the problem at hand.
> 
> The idea behind this principle is that it's often easier to understand and maintain code that is duplicated rather than code that is abstracted away behind layers of complexity. By duplicating code, developers can create code that is specific to the problem at hand, rather than trying to create a general-purpose abstraction that may not be perfectly suited for the task.
> 
> While this principle can be effective in certain situations, it's important to use it judiciously. Duplicating code can lead to increased maintenance costs and can make it harder to update code in the future. In addition, duplicating code can lead to inconsistencies in the codebase and can make it harder to ensure that changes are applied consistently throughout the project.
> 
> Ultimately, the decision to use the "Write everything twice" principle will depend on the specific situation at hand. It's important to carefully evaluate the tradeoffs of this approach and to consider the long-term impact on the project before making a decision.

And what about writing code to throw it away over overly dry code? 

> The idea of "writing code to throw it away" is based on the principle that sometimes it's better to write code quickly and without over-optimization or over-engineering in mind, with the expectation that it will be discarded later. This approach can be useful when developing a new feature or when exploring different approaches to a problem, as it allows developers to quickly prototype and experiment with different ideas.
> 
> In contrast, overly dry (Don't Repeat Yourself) code is code that has been over-optimized to reduce duplication and improve maintainability, but at the expense of clarity and readability. Overly dry code can be difficult to understand and maintain, and it can make it harder to add new features or make changes to the codebase.
> 
> While both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks, the decision of which approach to use will depend on the specific situation at hand. When working on a new feature or exploring different approaches to a problem, writing code to throw it away can be a useful approach, as it allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation. However, when working on production code that needs to be maintained over time, overly dry code can lead to increased complexity and reduced productivity.
> 
> In general, it's important to find a balance between these two approaches, taking into account the specific requirements and constraints of the project. By finding a balance between rapid prototyping and maintainable code, developers can ensure that their code is both functional and maintainable over the long term.
