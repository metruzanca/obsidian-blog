Hey Tim, hey Wyatt,

I wanted to thank you guys for kindly inviting me for an on-site / in person interview, I really enjoyed speaking with you two and look forward to potentially working along side you two.

I also wanted to follow up on some things we talked about during the interview:

> **Simplicity, Please**
> "The choice between speed and simplicity is a false dichotomy. Investment in simplicity is investment in speed."
> (*turns out its the 3rd key takeaway, not the 1st*)

You asked me for examples of good UI / Design , heres some more I've come up with:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): which is my note taking app
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): Digital Whiteboarding app (has multiplayer collab mode & excalidraw+ for teams ;) ;) )
- https://www.merixstudio.com/ : A software house with a really cool website
- https://camillemormal.com/ : A design portfolio which is just insane
- https://cal.com/ : Alternative to Calendly (open source), which I think makes some good improvements to the "scheduling date picker" experience.
- https://proton.me : Good consistency across all their apps and UI "feedback".

Tailwind related, this is the book I mentioned https://www.refactoringui.com/ & here is the color excerpt https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette. _And because I can't help it, have this too https://youtu.be/gJ2HOj22gDo which goes deeper into color theory about how color value aka "luminance" is not independent from hue or saturation and how color lightness (hsl) is not the same as color value._

As for questions, It's funny, I brought up performance reviews but I forgot to ask the more important follow up question which is _How do you measure performance?_ / _What qualities does someone in this role need to excel?_

Aside from that final question, again, I think you two were very clear in your pitch. However, you did present me with many problems / challenges that I can help but think about and want to solve. (_Which is why I'm often on discord, helping others solve their problems for fun._) So were an offer be extended (_and subsequently accepted_) I already have a list of questions to be answered / things to think about with the team. _One of which is where would whop's ideal "design system" fit in this [venn diagram](https://youtu.be/CQuTF-bkOgc?t=704 "venn diagram")?_

Anyways, I really enjoyed our conversation. Can't stress that enough.
