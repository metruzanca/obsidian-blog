- Broken blog links on whopio twitter (make blog.whop.com redirect to whop.com/blog)
- Made an account to try out the platform (ended up making a "company" type account). Found a bug where on the `https://dash.whop.com/home` page I am unable to logout (so that I can see the default site)

- As a new user, I'm unsure what to do on the site.

	- I think the "Learn more" needs to be a colorfull CTA button as I missed it on my first viewings. I mistook it for a slogan under the "Whop Marketplace" page title.
