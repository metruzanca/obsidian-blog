Fully expecting expectations to change over time as say i complete the ui kit / design system, which seems to be the _problem_ you want resolved. Just thought I'd clarify as i mention expectations a lot below. 

Would my role be solely focussed on working closely with Tim to refine the current components and implement a design system. And until this task is done i won't be working on other feature, though i will work with the core team to make sure the API i design is to liking and if new components are needed is work

Like i said during our interview, you were both very clear but i do have two question i forgot to ask. 

It's funny, i brought up performance reviews but i forgot to ask the follow up which is __How do you measure performance?__ / __What qualities does someone in this role need to excel?__

Next, i wanted to clarify what your expectations were. From my understanding it seems like you want a developer who's primary task (anywhere from 50% to 100% of the code i write) is to revamp the UI kit / Design System working closely with Tim. With the desired outcome is a "UI kit" that is easier to use and easier to remain consistent, off-loading some of the design work and allowing the core team focus on the Macro instead of the Micro or at least give them patterns to follow and be able to selectively focus on one better. 

("UI kit" in quotes because there's many types of Ui kits some which overlap with style system and some that don't. )
