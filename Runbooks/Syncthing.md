## Windows Setup

After [downloading the Zip](https://syncthing.net/downloads/), come to [this wiki page](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/autostart.html#autostart-windows-startup) and configure the startup script. Then install [SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/releases/latest) to have syncthing in your windows tray.
