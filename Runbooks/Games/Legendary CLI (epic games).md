### Ashen

Bought Ashen on Epic games store and using the legendary cli which is a CLI based client for the epic games store
```bash
yay -S aur/legendary
```

Not sure if its Ashen or not, but its a bit buggy

Legendary config is here
```bash
nano ~/.config/legendary/config.ini
```

Based on this [gh-issue page](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/issues/47) I've set my wine prefix to be from proton 5.13 which is installed via steam
